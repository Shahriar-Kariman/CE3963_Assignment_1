## Problem 1 - Compounding Terms in Credit Card

So I know that the nominal interest rate is $r = 16.9\%$ and the effective interest rate is $i_e = 18.407\%$ and I have the formula for calculating $i_e$ given a number of periods($n$). I can easily calcualte $n$.

$$
\begin{split}
i_e = (1+\frac{r}{n})^n - 1
\\
(i_e + 1) = (1+\frac{r}{n})^n
\\
\ln(1+i_e) = n \times \ln(1+\frac{r}{n})
\\
n = \frac{\ln(1+i_e)}{\ln(1+\frac{r}{n})}
\end{split}
$$

So I solved that using the fixed point iteration method on my calcualtor and got $\approx 337$ so this mean that we are pretty close to *compounding daily* but I can't say why we didn't just end up with $365$?
